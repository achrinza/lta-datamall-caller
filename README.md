> NOTE: This module is still under heavy development and shouldn't be used in production!

A well-tested, object-oriented, promise-based LTA Datamall API caller written in Typescript with built-in definitions.

## Installing / Getting started

This a over-engineered module that's really easy to install:

```shell
npm i lta-datamall-caller
```

This installs the module into your project's `node_modules` folder.

## Developing

### Built With
* Commitizen
* David
* ESLint
* Gulp.js
* Husky
* Jest
* Prettier
* Pump
* Request
* Semantic Release
* Typescript
* Uglify.js

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to have `nvm` installed to ease switching between Node.js and NPM versions.

Ensure that Node.js 10.15 and above is installed.


### Setting up Dev

Settings up a development environment is pretty simple:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/achrinza/lta-datamall-caller.git
cd lta-datamall-caller/
npm i
```

This will clone the repository and install all the neccessary dependencies.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
npm run build
```

This builds your code.

### Deploying / Publishing

```shell
#TODO: Write publishing steps
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

[SemVer](http://semver.org/) is used for versioning. [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) are used to enforce semantic versioning.

## Tests

Tests are done by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and are written in Typescript.

```ts
#TODO: Write test examples
```

## Style guide

There's no style guide. ESLint and Prettier will fix any issues.
